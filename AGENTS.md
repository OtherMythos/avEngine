# avEngine Agent Debug Server

A **read-only localhost REST API** for inspecting a running avEngine instance. It lets an
AI agent (or a developer with `curl`) query the live Ogre scene graph and basic engine
status — useful for answering questions like *"why is my mesh not visible?"* without
attaching a debugger.

The server is **read-only**: it never mutates engine state. It binds to `127.0.0.1`
only, and is compiled in behind the `DEBUG_SERVER` build option (on by default for
desktop builds, excluded from iOS/Android).

## Enabling it

Launch the engine with the `--debugServer` flag, giving the path to a project's setup
file as usual:

```sh
av /path/to/project/avSetup.cfg --debugServer          # default port 8788
av /path/to/project/avSetup.cfg --debugServer 9000     # custom port
```

The flag takes an optional port. Because of how the argument parser works, put
`--debugServer` **after** the positional `avSetup.cfg` path.

Confirm it started — the log prints:

```
Debug server listening on 127.0.0.1:8788
```

and:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8788/api | jq
```

returns the endpoint catalog. If the port is already in use, the engine logs an error and
keeps running without the server.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are `GET`, return `application/json`, and are served under `/api`.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api` | Self-describing catalog of endpoints. Includes `apiVersion` for feature detection. |
| `GET /api/status` | Engine liveness summary. |
| `GET /api/scene?root=<id>&depth=<n>&max=<n>` | Scene graph dump. |
| `GET /api/scene/node/<id>` | Deep dive on a single node. |

### Node identifiers

Ogre-Next scene nodes have **no names** — each is addressed by its numeric **id**
(`Ogre::Node::getId()`), which is stable for the life of the node. You obtain ids from
`/api/scene` and use them in `root=` and `/api/scene/node/<id>`.

### `GET /api/status`

```jsonc
{
  "engineVersion": "0.1.0 unstable",
  "gitHash": "6946087",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "uptimeSeconds": 42.7,
  "project": "MyGame",
  "renderSystem": "Metal",
  "fps": 59.9,
  "avgFps": 60.1,
  "frameTimeMs": 16.6,
  "window": { "width": 1280, "height": 720, "title": "MyGame" }
}
```

### `GET /api/scene`

Dumps the scene graph from both the dynamic and static scene roots. Bounded by:

- `root` — a node id to root the dump at. Omit to dump from both scene roots.
- `depth` — how many levels of children to descend (default `3`).
- `max` — cap on total nodes serialised (default `500`), to protect an agent's context budget.

```jsonc
{
  "truncated": false,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "memoryType": "dynamic",         // only present on the two scene-root nodes
      "pos":        [0, 0, 0],         // local position [x, y, z]
      "derivedPos": [0, 0, 0],         // world-space position
      "scale":      [1, 1, 1],
      "orient":     [1, 0, 0, 0],      // quaternion [w, x, y, z]
      "objects": [
        {
          "name": "player.mesh",
          "type": "Item",              // Ogre movable type: Item, Light, Camera, ...
          "visible": true,
          "castShadows": true,
          "worldAabb": { "centre": [0, 1, 0], "halfSize": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] }
        }
      ],
      "children": [ /* nested nodes, same shape */ ],
      "childCount": 14                 // present ONLY when truncated: real child count > children returned
    }
  ]
}
```

When a node is truncated (by `depth` or `max`), its `childCount` is emitted **instead of /
alongside** the returned `children`, and the top-level `"truncated"` is `true`. Drill into a
truncated branch with `?root=<id>` rather than raising `max`.

### `GET /api/scene/node/<id>`

```jsonc
{
  "id": 37,
  "pos":        [1, 0, 2],
  "derivedPos": [1, 0, 2],
  "scale":      [1, 1, 1],
  "orient":     [1, 0, 0, 0],
  "parentChain": [12, 1],              // parent ids, nearest first, up to the scene root
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "player.mesh", "type": "Item", "visible": true, "castShadows": true,
      "worldAabb": { "centre": [1, 1, 2], "halfSize": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] },
      "localAabb": { "centre": [0, 1, 0], "halfSize": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] }
    }
  ],
  "childCount": 0
}
```

## Recipes

**"Is the engine alive and what is it running?"**
```sh
curl -s localhost:8788/api/status | jq
```

**"Why is my mesh not visible?"**
1. Dump the scene shallowly and locate the node whose `objects[].name` is your mesh:
   ```sh
   curl -s "localhost:8788/api/scene?depth=2" | jq
   ```
2. If it's inside a truncated branch, drill in with its parent's id:
   ```sh
   curl -s "localhost:8788/api/scene?root=<id>&depth=3" | jq
   ```
3. Inspect the node directly:
   ```sh
   curl -s localhost:8788/api/scene/node/<id> | jq
   ```
   Check the object's `visible`, the node's `derivedPos` (is it where you expect, or off at
   the origin / far away?), `scale` (accidentally zero?), and `worldAabb` (is it behind the
   camera or degenerate?).

**Navigating a large scene without blowing your context window:** start at `depth=2`, then
follow `childCount` and `root=<id>` to drill down. Prefer this over cranking `max` up, which
returns the whole tree at once.

## Semantics

- **Error shape:** `{ "error": "..." }` with an HTTP status:
  - `404` — the requested node id doesn't exist.
  - `503` — the engine didn't service the request in time (paused in a debugger, hung, or
    shutting down). Requests are executed on the engine's main thread once per rendered
    frame, so a stalled engine will time out after ~2s.
  - `400` — bad parameters.
- Each response is a **snapshot of a single frame**.
- The API is **read-only**. `POST` is reserved for future mutation endpoints; check
  `apiVersion` in `/api` to detect capability changes.
