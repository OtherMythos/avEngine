# avEngine

#### A cross-platform 3d game engine
Written in c++, the avEngine is a game engine with support for features such as:

* Graphics by ogre3d 2.1.
* Focus on data driven content, with an embedded scripting language.
* An ECS for entities (entity component system).
* Real-time physics with bullet physics.
* Cross platform on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

#### Documentation
Documentation for the engine is hosted here:

https://avdocumentation.readthedocs.io

#### Testing
The engine has been built with a heavy emphasis on testing and test automation.
Infact, the tests that have been written are written entirely using the engine's embedded scripting language.
You can find a copy of the test scripts here:
